# Writer's Spark

Writer's Spark is a small web app that helps blocked writers get unstuck.

Instead of generating full text for you, it focuses on **why** you are stuck,
and gives targeted prompts, questions, and small challenges to get your own
words flowing again.

## Features

- Choose what is blocking you (perfectionism, plot problems, character issues, etc.)
- Pick a mode:
  - **Quick spark** – one fast prompt to nudge you into writing
  - **Deep dive** – reflective questions to unpack the block
  - **Timed challenge** – simple constraints to get you moving
- Get a tailored set of exercises based on your choice
- No login, no database – just a focused tool you can extend

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- **Tests:** pytest (for prompt logic)

## Getting started
